# Developer Fundamentals

## Don't Read the Dictionary

### What Does This Mean?

When you're learning a programming language like Python, you might feel the urge to memorize every single function, syntax rule, and trick. Itâ€™s almost like trying to learn a language by reading a dictionary from start to finish. But thatâ€™s not how real learning works!

### How Do Developers Actually Learn?

Even experienced developers donâ€™t know all the syntax or functions. Instead of memorizing everything, they:
- Understand what exists in the language.
- Learn to search for solutions when needed (Google, documentation, etc.).
- Recognize commonly used concepts and patterns.
- Focus on practical usage rather than theoretical memorization.

### Efficient Learning

To truly learn Python (or any language), you need to **use it**. Some features and functions are used frequently, while others are rarely needed. Just like in human languages, there are common words like *the*, *and*, *or* that you use all the time, while some words are rarely encountered.

We'll take an approach that:
- Focuses on the **20% of the language** that is used **80% of the time**.
- Covers advanced or niche topics when necessary but doesnâ€™t dwell on them upfront.
- Encourages learning by **building projects** and solving real problems.

### Key Takeaway

Your first **Developer Fundamental** is this:
> **Don't learn a programming language as if you're trying to get 100% on a test.**

Instead, focus on:
- Writing code.
- Solving problems.
- Understanding key concepts.

By doing so, youâ€™ll become an efficient and skilled developerâ€”one that companies want to hire!

## Commenting Your Code

### Why Commenting Matters

Commenting your code is an essential skill for every programmer. It helps others (and your future self) understand the purpose of your code. However, there are good and bad ways to comment.

### Good vs. Bad Comments

#### Bad Comments
```python
# Assigns the string "Andre" to the variable name
name = "Andre"
```
*Why is this bad?* This comment states the obvious. Your code should be **self-explanatory** and easy to read without unnecessary comments.

#### Good Comments
```python
# Converts user input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
user_input = input("Enter your name: ").strip().lower()
```
*Why is this good?* It explains **why** the code is written this way, not just **what** it does.

### Best Practices for Commenting
- **Write self-explanatory code first.** If your code is unclear, improve it instead of relying on comments.
- **Use comments to explain *why*, not *what*.** Describe the reasoning behind complex logic.
- **Avoid redundant comments.** Donâ€™t comment on things that are obvious from the code.
- **Update comments when updating code.** Outdated comments cause confusion.
- **Use docstrings for functions and modules.**

#### Example:
```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount):
    """Calculates the final price after applying a discount."""
    return price - (price * discount / 100)
```

### Key Takeaway
> **More comments donâ€™t mean better code.** Keep comments concise and useful, and focus on writing clear, readable code.

Mastering this fundamental will make your code more maintainable and help you work effectively in teams!

## Understanding Data Structures

### Why Data Structures Matter

A great programmer is someone who knows **when to use which data structure**. While you can learn definitions and examples, real expertise comes from **practice and experience**. Understanding the trade-offs between different data structures is crucial.

### Lists vs. Dictionaries

#### Lists:
- **Ordered** (maintains sequence of elements).
- **Indexed** (each element has a position).
- **Used when order matters** (e.g., a queue of customers waiting in line).

```python
queue = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
```

#### Dictionaries:
- **Unordered** (doesnâ€™t maintain sequence).
- **Key-value pairs** (provides meaningful labels for data).
- **Used when data needs structure** (e.g., storing user information).

```python
user = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "weapons": ["sword", "shield"],
    "is_magic": True
}
```

### When to Use What?
- If **order matters**, use a **list**.
- If **you need to label data**, use a **dictionary**.
- If **you need fast lookups**, use a **dictionary**.
- If **you have simple, ordered data**, use a **list**.

As you practice more, you'll **develop intuition** about choosing the right data structure for the problem at hand.

### Key Takeaway
> **A great programmer understands the trade-offs of different data structures and picks the right one for the task.**

Throughout the course, you'll gain experience by working with different data structures in various projects and exercises.

## Indentation in Python

### Why Indentation Matters

Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces `{}` to define code blocks, Python relies on **indentation**. This means the number of spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line determines the structure of the code.

### How Indentation Works
```python
if True:
    print("This is indented correctly")
    print("This is part of the block")
```

If indentation is incorrect, Python will raise an error:
```python
if True:
print("This will cause an IndentationError")
```
**Output:**
```
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

### Best Practices for Indentation
- Use **4 spaces per indentation level** (PEP 8 recommendation).
- **Do not mix spaces and tabs** in the same file.
- Keep indentation consistent within a block.
- Use an IDE or text editor with auto-formatting support.

### Indentation in Loops and Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Alice")
```

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)  # Indented correctly
```

### Key Takeaway
> **Indentation is crucial in Python. Maintain consistency and use 4 spaces per level.**

Following this fundamental ensures your code is readable and error-free!

## What is Good Code?

### Characteristics of Good Code
1. **Clean:** Follows best practices and coding styles.
2. **Readable:** Easy for others (and your future self) to understand.
3. **Predictable:** Avoids overly complex or clever solutions.
4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoids unnecessary duplication.

### Example of Clean Code
```python
def print_tree(rows, symbol="*"):
    for i in range(1, rows + 1):
        print(symbol * i)

print_tree(5)
```
### Key Takeaway
> **Good code is clean, readable, predictable, and avoids repetition.**

By following these principles, you'll write professional, maintainable code that others will appreciate!
